# ewebs-php
The Ewebs PHP library provides convenient access to the Ewebs API from applications written in the PHP language. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible with a wide range of versions of the Ewebs API.
